The target browsers are desktop browsers, such as Google Chrome and Safari. These are the browsers that I have tested with and are the ones that I have ensured work with my site.

I used the NYC Wi-Fi Hotspot Locations API: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Wi-Fi-Hotspot-Locations/yjub-udmw

The visualizations that my project utilizes are a map that shows the location of each hotspot location and a barchart of the distribution of the hotspot in each borough.

My project utilizes Leaflet for a map and Chart.js for a barchart.

Although I created my own CSS layout, I utilized Flexbox and the latest version is CSS3.

My project aims to display the different free Wi-Fi hotspots around New York City. The problem it aims to solve is the problem of the lack of accessible access to a reliable internet connection. It displays the amount of Wi-Fi hotspots to help those who want to find a free Wi-Fi hotspot. In addition, the bargraph helps visualize which areas of New York City has the most Wi-Fi hotspots available and which places could use more.
